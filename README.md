# email_App

What a cool app that tests your beginner and moving into intermediate skills!  I loved this app because I was able to make it my own with unique print statements!  

## learning the power of the constructor!

This app was different from what we did in Launchcode in that the constructor for the email was where we did so much calling of methods--I'm pretty sure we didn't use the constructor in this way 100% of the time.  At first, I was a bit confused, but at this point, I understand the relationship betweent constructor and main so much better!
